Welcome to my webpage :) This homepage will probably be updated with what's going on right now. Originally I had intended for this to be a place to host some notes/writings. 

This summer, I am an Admin TA for [CS 70](https://www.eecs70.org). All course materials and policies are on the website.

I also participated in and contributed a talk to the [A&M Mathematical Physics Summer School](https://sites.google.com/site/jakefillman/summer-school-2025). Notes and slides from this can be found in [expository](/expository).
