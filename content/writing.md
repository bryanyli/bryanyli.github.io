## Papers

1. [Flat Bands, Dirac Cones, and Higher Order Band Crossings in Twisted Multilayer Graphene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02011), with [Mengxuan Yang](https://sites.google.com/view/mxyang/homepage?authuser=0), 2025.

## Expository

Here are some expository things that I have written. These are likely neither correct nor complete, but if you find any mistakes feel free to let me know.

- Notes from the [Texas A&M 2025 Summer School in Mathematical Physics](https://sites.google.com/site/jakefillman/summer-school-2025): Will be uploaded shortly
    - Quantum Chaos and RMT: 
    - Quantum Dynamics:
    - Grushin Problems:
    <!-- - Slides from contributed talk (by me!): Band Crossings in Twisted Multilayer Graphene -->

- Miscellaneous:
    - LLM-typeset version of notes on the [Geometry of Characteristic Classes](/static/pdfs/Chern_CC.pdf) by S.-S. Chern. Note: There are formatting errors on pages 14-15, and extra paragraph breaks inserted by the LLM that I have yet to fix.
