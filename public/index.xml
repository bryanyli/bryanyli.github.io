      <description>I am an undergraduate at UC Berkeley doing a double degree in mathematics and computer science. I am generally interested in geometry, analysis, PDEs, and mathematical physics, and especially in the intersections. However, I am also interested in other areas of math and computer science.
I can be contacted at byli [] berkeley [] edu, where the blanks are filled in with the obvious placeholders.</description>
